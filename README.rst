XMOS UART Library
.................

A software defined, industry-standard, UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter) component that allows you to control an UART
serial connection via the xCORE GPIO hardware-response ports. This
component is controlled via C using the XMOS multicore extensions and
can either act as UART master or slave.

Features
........

 * UART receive and transmit
 * Supports speeds up to 10MBit/s
 * Half-duplex handshaking mode (applicable to RS485)
 * Efficient multi-uart mode for implementing multiple connections

Configurations
..............

 * Standard UART mode
 * Fast streaming UART mode
 * Multi-UART mode
